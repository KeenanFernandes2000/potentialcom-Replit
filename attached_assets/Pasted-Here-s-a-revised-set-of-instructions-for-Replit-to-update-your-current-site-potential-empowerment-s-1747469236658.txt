Here’s a revised set of instructions for Replit to update your current site (potential-empowerment-shadi3.replit.app) so that it aligns with the new GTM strategy and site structure while keeping what already works.

⸻

✅ What to Keep from the Existing Page

✔ Hero Section
	•	Keep the main message framing:
“Empower your business with AI agents and micro platforms.”
	•	Retain the visual simplicity and clarity

✔ Visual Style
	•	Maintain the minimalist, clean design
	•	Keep the blue-toned theme as a base (unless new branding evolves)

⸻

Replace with these links:
	•	Home
	•	AI Agents
	•	Platforms
	•	Solutions
	•	Pricing
	•	Learn

Each should scroll to the relevant section or link to a subpage (you can keep them all as anchor sections for now).
